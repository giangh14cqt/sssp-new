# Negative-Weight Single-Source Shortest Paths

## To run the program

Example:

Enter filename (eg: "../graph/500_2.txt"): ../graph/500_2.txt<br/>
Enter source vertex: 1<br/>
Enter 1 for LDD, 0 for no LDD: 0<br/>
Running Bellman-Ford from source: 1 LDD = 0<br/>
Bellman-Ford took 0.026957 seconds.<br/>
Running Bit Scaling from source: 1 LDD = 0<br/>
Bit scaling took 14.1181 seconds<br/>
Bellman-Ford and Las Vegas are equal<br/>
